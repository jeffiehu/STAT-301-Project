    "Let’s set the scene: securing a job placement has always been a big concern for many students, especially in a climate where everyone’s hustling hard. Colleges encourage skill-building activities (like internships, projects, and workshops), emphasizing both hard skills and soft skills, hoping these experiences increase the odds of landing a job. Naturally, we can’t overlook traditional academic performance measures such as CGPA, SSC, and HSC marks. And that’s where our dataset steps in, providing detailed info on academic achievements, skill-enhancement activities, personal attributes (like AptitudeTestScore and SoftSkillRating), and whether or not a student got placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "With so many facets playing into job outcomes, we want to explore whether a particular factor, like CGPA, internship count, or extracurricular involvement is actually associated with better placement prospects. This question is important not just for students to plan their college activities, but also for educational institutions looking to refine their training programs.\n",

    "The main objective is to understand and interpret the associations between predictors and placement outcomes. While predictive performance (e.g., accuracy, AUC-ROC) is explored, the emphasis remains on identifying which factors most strongly influence placement likelihood. This prioritizes actionable insights for students and educators over pure predictive power."

    "The stacked histograms illustrate the distribution of students' CGPA, differentiated by Placement Status (using colour) and separated by the number of internships. From the plot, students with higher CGPA tend to secure placements more frequently, especially noticeable among students who, despite having no internships, have more placements than not placed. The plot also reveals that students with two internships show a higher likelihood of placement, even at somewhat lower CGPAs. Conversely, there's little visible distinction between students with zero or one internship in terms of CGPA distribution or placement outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a noticeable trend in CGPA distribution based on internship experience. This could be because students who actively pursue internships tend to maintain higher CGPAs overall or vice versa, as evident in the fact that students with 2 internships exhibit a distribution that's left-skewed (higher CGPAs), whereas students with 0 internships exhibit a right-skewed distribution (moderate to lower CGPAs).\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization is relevant because it helps us explore the relationship between academic performance, practical experience, and placement success. The plot highlights that CGPA is a key factor in placement but also shows that internships may influence placement likelihood independently of GPA. By faceting the histogram by internship experience, we can observe how CGPA distributions shift based on the number of internships, revealing that students with more internships tend to have both higher CGPAs and higher placement rates. This is crucial for the inference question stated earlier, as it suggests that both academic achievement and internship experience may be important in securing a job placement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important because it means that excluding either one of these variables could lead to omitted variable bias. For example, if we were to exclude internships from our analysis, our model might overestimate the impact of CGPA on placement success, failing to account for the fact that internships provide an alternative pathway to placement, even for students with moderate CGPAs. On the other hand, omitting CGPA could lead to overstating the effect of internships, ignoring the clear trend that students with higher GPAs are generally more likely to be placed, regardless of internship experience. Therefore, our model should include both CGPA and internships at the very least."

    "The heatmap provides a quick and intuitive overview of which predictors are more strongly associated with placement outcomes, helping to prioritize variables for further analysis. Notably, the heatmap shows that the strongest relationships with PlacementStatus, are AptitudeTestScore (0.52) and HSC_Marks (0.51), suggesting that higher aptitude test scores and high school academic performance are closely linked to successful job placements. Other notable factors include Projects (0.48), SSC_Marks (0.47), ExtracurricularActivities (0.48), SoftSkillsRating (0.43), and CGPA (0.42), each demonstrating moderate positive relationships with placement outcomes. On the other hand, factors like Internships (0.26), PlacementTraining (0.32), and Workshops.Certifications (0.36) have weaker correlations, suggesting that while they're still beneficial, they may not be primary predictors of placement success.\n",

For example, variables like HSC_Marks, SSC_Marks, and AptitudeTestScore show moderate correlations with each other (eg. above 0.5). However, a correlation of just above 0.5 is not enough to suggest multicollinearity between the variables, and VIF will be used later on to determine whether multicollinearity is present."

    "The stepwise AIC selection process helped find the most important factors that influence whether a student gets placed. When we added AptitudeTestScore, the AIC dropped significantly from 9523.1 to 7346.77, indicating a huge improvement. When we added ExtracurricularActivites, AIC again shows a drop to 6716.15，showing that extracurricular activities adds substantial predictive value. The rest are also added in the following order: SSC_Marks, PlacementTraining, CGPA, SoftSkillsRating, Projects, HSC_Marks, Workshop.Certifications. However, Internships were never included because it never reduced the AIC enough to justify its complexity.\n",

Evidently, the selected predictors significantly improve the fit of the model. "

    "All predictors in the final logistic regression model are statistically significant at a confidence level of 95% and positively associated with placement. However, it is worth noting that some have stronger effects than others. Notably, a unit increase in PlacementTraining is associated with an increase in PlacementStatus by a factor of 2.43. Similarly, a unit increase in ExtracurricularActivities is associated with an increase in PlacementStatus by a factor of 2.08, and a unit increase in SoftSkillsRating is associated with an increase in PlacementStatus by a factor of 1.92. Smaller but still meaningful effects are observed for CGPA (a factor of 1.58), Projects (a factor of 1.31), Workshops.Certifications (a factor of 1.12), AptitudeTestScore (a factor of 1.07), SSC_Marks (a factor of 1.03), and HSC_Marks (a factor of 1.02). Overall, this suggests that students may benefit from not only maintaining strong academic records but also actively engaging in soft skill development and practical experiences to enhance their placement prospects.\n",

    "The goal of this study was to determine whether academic achievements, skill-enhancement activities, and personal attributes can predict a student’s job placement success. Using logistic regression on the training dataset, we developed a model that identified several key predictors significantly associated with placement outcomes. These included Aptitude Test Score, CGPA, number of Projects, Soft Skills Rating, SSC and HSC marks, participation in Extracurricular Activities, Placement Training, and the number of Workshops/Certifications attended.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nine variables contributed signficantly to the likelihood of being placed. For instance, on the final model, we see that students who participated in placement training were 2.4 times more likely to be placed than those who did not, while those involved in extracurricular activities were twice as likely to be placed. Increases in academic performance indicators like CGPA, SSC, and HSC marks also contributed positively, although to varying degrees. Importantly, soft skills and project involvement, often underemphasized, showed strong positive associations with placement success.\n",

    "The final model performed well, as it approximately had a 76% accuracy ($\\frac{1426 + 977}{1426 + 283 + 315 + 977}$) on the test set. The analysis of the confusion matrix showed a good balance between precision and recall for predicting whether a student would be placed. In addition, the ANOVA test comparing the final model to the null model confirmed a significant improvement, suggesting that the selected predictors offer meaningful insights into placement outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results were aligned with expectations, as it showcased that both academic and non-academic factors as influential. However, the strong effect of soft skills, extracurriculars, and training solifies the importance of well-roundedness for students. To further improve the model, exploring interaction effects or incorporating additional variables such as resume quality or interview scores. These findings have practical implications for career services and students alike, emphasizing that success in job placement depends on more than just good grades."
